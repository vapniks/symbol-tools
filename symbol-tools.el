;; This file contains various helper functions for handling symbols. 
;; The code originally comes from chapter 4.7 of onlisp by Paul Graham:
;; http://www.bookshelf.jp/texi/onlisp/onlisp_5.html#SEC35
;; 
;;;;

;;; Functions:
;;
;;  - `mkstr' : Make a string from the list of `args'. Each arg can be a string or a symbol.
;;  - `symb' : Make a symbol from the list of `args'. Each arg can be a string or a symbol.
;;  - `reread' : Make a symbol from the list of `args'. Each arg can be a string or a symbol.
;;  - `explode' : Given symbol `sym', return a list of symbols for the individual chars making up `sym'.
;;  - `get-matching-symbols' : Return a list of all symbols in `obary' whose names match the regular expression `regex'.
;;  - `unintern-matching-symbols' : Remove all symbols whose name matches `regex' from the obarray `obary'.
;;


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put symbol-tools.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'symbol-tools)

;;; Customize:
;;
;; To automatically insert descriptions of customizable variables defined in this buffer
;; place point at the beginning of the next line and do: M-x auto-document

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET symbol-tools RET
;;
